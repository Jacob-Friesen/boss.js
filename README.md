boss.js
=======

Helps you code JavaScript at a boss level. Provides a set of utilities intended to deal with JSs rough edges and provide close imitations of useful future [Harmony](http://wiki.ecmascript.org/doku.php?id=harmony:specification_drafts) proposals.

Driving Goals:

* **Boss:** The result of the below objectives.
* **Organized:** In such a way that makes it easy to include only what you need.
* **Small:** Doing the absolute minimum to achieve functionality.
* **Simple:** Syntax should feel natural to you as a JS developer (without messing with Object and etc.)

*This is an experiment into ways of improving my workflow and hopefully others. It will probably go through a lot of architecture transitions until I get a final vision. Finally, it is intended to complement popular utility libaries like underscore, not compete.*
